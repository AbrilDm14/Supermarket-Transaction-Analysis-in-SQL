# Supermarket Transaction Analysis-in-SQL
An important aspect for retailers to analyze include whether people prefer to purchase by card or cash, whether the time of day affects shopping habits and if those self-checkout machines are faster than having cashiers. These are some of the questions posed by supermarkets to understand the behavior of customers and to make informed decisions about store operations, marketing strategies and customer service enhancements.

In this analysis we will use SQL to analyze transaction data from a Polish Supermarket to answer financial and logical questions.

A financial analysis of point of sale transactions can have many objectives, including:

- Increasing sales by identifying customers' wants and needs.
- Increasing productivity of stores and operations by identifying processes that might take too much time.
- Predicting sales to inform decisions on investments.
